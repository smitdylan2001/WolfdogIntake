# Mechanics
The stealth mechanic in this game is to sneak up behind patrolling enemies and put a bucket over their head to blind them. This is inspired from a bug/feature in Skyrim!

This game is made in Unity 2020.3 LTS, with XR Managment. I did not use the Oculus Integration package.
The enemies' behavior is managed by a finite state machine (fsm). 

I used VR Interaction Framework for the fundamentals of this game: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/templates/systems/vr-interaction-framework-161066
