# Mechanics
The stealth mechanic in this game is to sneak up behind patrolling enemies and put a bucket over their head to blind them. This is inspired from a bug/feature in Skyrim!


I used VR Interaction Framework for the fundamentals of this game: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/templates/systems/vr-interaction-framework-161066
